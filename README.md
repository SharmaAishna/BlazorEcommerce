# How do I build this Repository?

I used the repository pattern here. The data access layer is separated from the business logic.
In Blazor Server Project, the Admin can perform CRUD operations on the products, categories, and set the price according to the size of the clothes.
In the Client Webassembly project, consumers consume data using API's.
